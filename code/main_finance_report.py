"""
main_finance_report.py — the Finance department's report.

Finance cares about the audit trail: every transaction, and what the whole day
earned.

This file is an *interface*, not a library. Notice how little it does: it calls
the pipeline in order and arranges the output. Every calculation lives in
`sales_pipeline.transform`, every bit of formatting lives in
`sales_pipeline.display`. If you find yourself doing arithmetic in this file,
that logic belongs in the package instead — where it can be unit tested and where
Marketing can reuse it.

Before running:  pip install -r requirements.txt
